<p >A hobby is nothing but a gentle and pleasant occupation designed to take the tired brain off the burden of the main task. It is not one’s main business or occupation; it is an alternative mental occupation. I believe that every person should have a hobby because, without a favorite occupation, it’s just boring to live. Hobby helps to develop a person, because, while doing what he likes, a person always strives to learn something new about his favorite occupation, often communicates with other people who are addicted to the same thing. A person who has a hobby tries to read. Everyone has a favorite hobby. I have also a favorite hobby. My favorite hobby is cycling. It is my favorite sports to do whenever I have free time.  Not just because of it good for our health, if we also can enjoy the scenery and feel the natural winds. It is a good exercise to improve family relationships or a friend’s relationships. Most of the time I am cycling with my best friend, while we cycling we were chatting or even gossiping about anything. You have to find the perfect place to cycling harmoniously without any destruction such as a park, housing area or anyplace, as long as that place has a good road, so that you won’t fall because of the road. The benefits of cycling are numerous not just for the person peddling but for the environment, therefore, society as a whole too. It’s a heart health hobby that enhances brain activity and reduces carbon gas release. It’s also a fun outdoor activity that stimulates the senses which are dulled by staying indoors too close to the television and refrigerator. Unlike both swimming and running, cyclists can enjoy a conversation with a fellow rider. Cycling is easier on the joints than running and can be enjoyed all seasons, unlike swimming. All-in-all cycling is a beneficial physical activity and hobby. </p>
